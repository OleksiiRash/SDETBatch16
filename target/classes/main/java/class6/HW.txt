If any day from 1-5 → output “It is a weekday”, anyway from 6-7 → output “It is a weekend”, any other day → output “Invalid day”

Task 2: Ask user to enter a number and then define if number is small, medium or large
Small number is value between 1 and 10
Medium number is value between 11 and 100
Large number is value between 101 and 1000

Task 3: Write a program that will ask user to input inputs the current time (use 24-hour format).
Based on the given time define:
if hour is between 1-11 --> Morning
if hour between 12-15 --> Afternoon
if hour between 16-20 --> Evening

if user is born in June, July, August → season =”Summer”  etc …
At the end of the program we should see 1 output as “You were born is season __”.

Task 5: Write a program that will read three inputs of scores (quiz, mid-term, and final scores) and determine the grade based on the following rules:
if the average score >=90 → grade=A
if the average score >= 70 and <90 → grade=B
if the average score>=50 and <70 → grade=C
if the average score<50 → grade=F

Task 6: Ask user to enter their country and capture it. Once values are captured print which language user speaks.

Task 7: Allow user to enter grade (A, B, or C etc...) and then provide explanation: A-Excellent, B-Good, C-Average, D-Bad, any other grade --> Not Acceptable.
At the end your program should print which grade was entered by a user with explanation.
