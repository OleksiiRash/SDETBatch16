Method Overriding:

    it's when a subclass has the exact same method as parent method but a different
    implementation.

What are the benefits of Method Overriding.

    1) Flexibility(if you don't like something from the parent class you can override it).
    2) Cleaner code

Rules:

    1) if we want to override a method in the child class return type,method name and parameters they must be same.
    2) private methods can't be overridden.
    3) We can't override constructors.
    4) static methods

Note: Without Inheritance method overriding is not possible!
