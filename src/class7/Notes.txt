Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a piece of code until a condition is false.
why should we use loops?
    By using loops we can avoid code duplication.
what is the Syntax for a while loop?
    while(condition){
    // code that we want to repeat
    }

==========================================
1)Read the question carefully.
2) Pay attention to the terms that i use in the class.
3) Never ever try to write the logic for the complete task in one go sentence by sentence

Use a for loop when you know the exact number of iterations you need to execute,
and use a while loop when you don't know the exact number of iterations,
but you know the condition that should terminate the loop


for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
==========================================
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

// we can use a short code for creating for loop using just for + i combination


==========================================
do while loop important to check syntax and know what you should do step by step

int j = 20;
        do {
            if (j % 2 != 0) {
                System.out.print(j + " ");
            }
            j++;
        }
        while (j <= 50);
