Long Definition:

In Java, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed.
It serves as a blueprint for other classes and provides a common interface or behavior that its subclasses must implement.
An abstract class may contain abstract methods, which are declared without an implementation and must be defined in its concrete subclasses.
Additionally, abstract classes can have non-abstract methods with a defined implementation.
By marking a class as abstract, you indicate that it is meant to be extended and should not be instantiated directly.

Short definition:

Abstraction is a process of hiding the
implementation details and showing only
functionality to the user.

Means that something is not complete, wait to be complete etc.

Abstract class restrict anybody to create an object of that class
once you have the abstract methods you need to have the abstract class as well!

We can make the child class abstract as well but in this case we will not have
possibility to have the object of the child class.

We can have some abstract methods and some not if we feel that some methods
will be full represent in the parent class.

We can have all (variables, constructor etc.) in the class expect
create the object of the class

-------------------------
Interface forced us to write the methods and logic in a exact way as it was defined!
-------------------------
in Selenium important to revise those Java concepts:

if else
loops Nested loop
break keyword
classes and objects
String class
types of variables
Methods
abstraction
polymorphism
interfaces
