2D Arrays

// first option
data type [][] variableName = new data type [size of rows][size of columns];

// second option

  int[][] matrix = {
                {10, 20, 30},  // first comes rows index and them column index
                {20, 50, 65},
                {102, 54, 60}

    4) It will become easier to write code by multiple team members.
    5) security of you application will increase.
    6) writing code for larger applications will become easy.
