The Math class in Java is a built-in utility class that provides methods
for performing various mathematical operations. It is part of the java.lang package,
which is automatically imported in every Java program.

Here are some of the most commonly used methods of the Math class:

Math.abs(): This method returns the absolute value of a number.
For example, Math.abs(-10) will return 10.

Math.ceil(): This method returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.
For example, Math.ceil(3.14) will return 4.0.

Math.floor(): This method returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
For example, Math.floor(3.14) will return 3.0.

Math.max(): This method returns the maximum of two numbers.
For example, Math.max(5, 10) will return 10.

Math.min(): This method returns the minimum of two numbers.
For example, Math.min(5, 10) will return 5.

Math.pow(): This method returns the value of a number raised to a given power.
For example, Math.pow(2, 3) will return 8.0.

Math.sqrt(): This method returns the square root of a number.
For example, Math.sqrt(25) will return 5.0.

Math.random(): This method returns a random double value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
For example, Math.random() will return a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Math.PI: This is a constant field that represents the mathematical constant pi (Ï€).

These are just a few examples of the methods available in the Math class.
By using the Math class, you can perform complex mathematical operations with ease in your Java programs.
