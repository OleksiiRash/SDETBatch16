In Java, a ternary operator (also known as a conditional operator)
is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.
The syntax of a ternary operator is as follows:

---------------------------------------
condition ? expression1 : expression2
---------------------------------------
The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false.
If the condition is true, the operator returns expression1, otherwise it returns expression2.

The ternary operator is often used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.
For example, instead of writing a full if-else statement like this:
---------------------
int x = 10;
int y;
if (x > 5) {
    y = 1;
} else {
    y = 0;
}
----------------------
We can use the ternary operator to write the same code in a more concise way:
----------------------
int x = 10;
int y = (x > 5) ? 1 : 0;
------------------------
This code assigns the value 1 to the variable y if x > 5 is true, and assigns the value 0 to y otherwise.
Ternary operators can also be nested, allowing us to write more complex conditional statements in a concise way.
For example:
-------------------------------------
int x = 10;
String result = (x > 5) ? ((x < 20) ? "x is between 5 and 20" : "x is greater than or equal to 20") : "x is less than or equal to 5";
---------------------------------------------------------
This code assigns a String value to the variable result based on the value of x.
If x is greater than 5 and less than 20, result will be assigned the String "x is between 5 and 20".
If x is greater than or equal to 20, result will be assigned the String "x is greater than or equal to 20".
If x is less than or equal to 5, result will be assigned the String "x is less than or equal to 5".

It's worth noting that while ternary operators can be more concise than if-else statements,
they can also be less readable if they become too complex.
It's important to balance conciseness with readability in your code.
