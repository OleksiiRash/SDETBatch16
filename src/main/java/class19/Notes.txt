MethodOverloading:
    allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters.


How to have different signatures?

    1) By changing the number of parameters that a method takes
    2) By changing the dataTypes of the parameters.
    3) By changing the sequence of parameters.

Why should we Overload?

    1)cleanliness
    2)Increases the readability of the program.

    3) We don't have to memorize a lot of method names if we are performing the same operation.

Method Overloading:

    1) Can we overload private methods?
    Yes
    2) Can we Overload the static methods?
    Yes
    3) Can we overload the main method?
    Yes
    4) Can we overload a method by changing its return type?
