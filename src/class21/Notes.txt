Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a
common superclass. It allows a single interface or method to be
implemented by multiple classes in different ways.
This concept enables flexibility, code reusability,
and enhances the maintainability of the codebase.

In Java, polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
Let's explore each of these with examples:

Method Overriding:
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation
of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in
the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list
as the method in the superclass.

instanceof - simply check do the class belong to the parent class or not, so we can use it with if condition to check before class casting the object

final keywords mean that we can add it to the method or data type to finalize them in order not override it!
We can use final keyword for all if we don`t whant to inherit or overload, override, or anything else.
